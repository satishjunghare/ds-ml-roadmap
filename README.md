# Data Science and Machine Learning Roadmap

## # What is Data Science and Machine Learning?
**Data Science** is an interdisciplinary field that combines various techniques, tools, and methodologies to extract insights and knowledge from data. It involves the collection, cleaning, organization, analysis, and interpretation of large volumes of data to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations.

**Machine Learning** is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the design, development, and implementation of computational models that can automatically learn patterns and relationships in data through experience.
